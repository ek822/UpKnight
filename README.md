## How it works


## Inspiration
💫Learning to gain a better understanding of integrity, as part of the principles of the CIA Triad that is essential to any cybersecurity infrastructure. As well as Hashing Algorithms to encypt and secure senstive data when 

## Future Additions (in-progress)
Ability for user to select the type of Hash they want to use
Integrate features from AWS, have the data be populated/updated
Enhance for code for more usuability

## Challenges/Takeaways
Powershell syntax, Data Structures
